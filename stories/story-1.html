                        <p>“Hey Harry let’s go to the newly opened museum and buy something rare, you know “A new museum had just opened in the
                        town David and harry were going to see thing inside the museum and if can buy something because they were very rich
                        celebrities. They had so many rare things. In their house like: Hitler’s telephone, The museum were The management was
                        pleased to invite them, Then they went inside when they saw The coffin of Horus - The god of death and the clock of
                        hagatha - The dark witch, Rumors has it that when she was killed by the witch hunters, she transferred her soul into the
                        clock, but David never believed such thing but as for harry he was always afraid of ghosts, spells, and even silly ghost
                        stories. After the tour of the museum they decided to buy the clock to put in their collections of rare and haunted
                        things. when they put the clock in their collection’s room and locked it when it was all tidy but the next day it was
                        like someone had searched for something. “maybe ghosts could have done it” said harry “there is no such thing as ghosts”
                        David responded with a harsh tone in his voice. They once more put the things in order and went to their relatives
                        wedding. It was a long trip and David felt a sleep as soon as the car started moving. "In the middle of nowhere a clock
                        with similarities with the clock of hagatha standing with fierce legs and arms magicly conjured a torch and lighted a
                        small cardboard house as soon as David house." He didn’t know what was happening, and it turned forwards him and snapped
                        the house into his chest eventually burning him. Aah aah fire aah he shouted and was woken by harry who was shouting.
                        David, David, listen to me, do you hear me, David he woke up and didn’t mind Harry’s yells and was thinking was it a
                        just a dream! he couldn’t resist the curiosity he told the driver to go back as soon as passible that’s where the truth
                        unfolds no, no, Nooo …… <span>to be continued</span>
